Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap

Your process/approach.
My approach for this portfolio was to create a simple and clean one page portfolio. I started by making the sidebar and the landing section. From there, I made each individual section for the my experience, projects, skills, and contact. I incorportated some bootstrap to make the project screenshots a carousel. Once the layout was done, I focused on the styling to make the page a little nicer while still keeping a simple design.

Your biggest wins and challenges.
I was happy with the style of my portfolio since I feel like CSS in one of the areas I have a lot to improve on.
